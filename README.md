# React_flux_Milind
Practice on flux architecture of react js

In this project I have created a folder structure that will be used in flux architecture.

This application is simple and in view you will see one button "Employee List", if you click on it, the employee list will be viewed.

To run this application on your machine, download this project to your local machine and open terminal or cmd with project file as root. Then follow,
      1. npm install (it will install all the modules on which our app is dependent.)
      2. npm start (this will start the server)
      3. now goto browser and type localhost:8080/src/index.html
